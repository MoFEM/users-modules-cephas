Check before run
================

* Check where is your mesh file
* Check what verion of openmpi (or other MPI library) are you using

First partition mesh (in this case it is partitioned in two: -my_nparts 2 )

Example Static (simple_elastcity)
==========================

mpirun -np 2 ./simple_elasticity -file_name simple_elasticity_2part.h5m -ksp_type gmres -pc_type lu -pc_factor_mat_solver_package mumps -ksp_monitor -my_order 2

Contact interaction between elastic solids having matching meshes in the 
contact interface.

Definition of the contact interface(s)
======================================

Contacting solids should be merged (i.e. glued) along the apparent contact 
interface(s) in the input mesh. Each contact interface should be introduced in
the bulk of the mesh as a BLOCKSET with a name starting with "INT_CONTACT". An
arbitrary number of contact interfaces may be defined, each including an 
arbitrary number of meshed surfaces.

The following rules for the definition of contact interfaces apply:
1. External edge of a contact interface may belong to the skin of the solid 
mesh (i.e. contact interface may cut through the whole solid).
2. External edge of a contact interface may belong to the interior of the 
solid mesh if and only if this edge also belongs to another contact interface,
which cuts through the whole solid (i.e. contact interfaces may intersect inside 
the mesh, but a contact interface cannot cut the solid mesh partially, e.g. 
similar to a crack notch).
3. If two surfaces do not have shared edges, but the distance between these 
surfaces is less than 3 elements in the bulk mesh, they must be included 
separately into two different contact interfaces.

Contact parameters
==================

my_order        approximation order for the field of spatial positions
my_order_lambda approximation order for the field of Lagrange multipliers
my_cn_value     augmentation parameter, primarily affects the convergence and 
                has minimal effect on the solution; recommended initial value is 
                the Young's modulus of contacting solids (or harmonic mean in case of 
                different values); the optimal value of cn providing minimal 
                number of iterations for a given tolerance threshold can be 
                found by repetitively increasing/decreasing the initial value 
                by e.g. a factor of 10

Contact interaction between elastic solids having matching meshes in the 
contact interface.

Definition of the contact interface(s)
======================================

In the input mesh contacting solids should be merged (i.e. glued) along the 
apparent contact interface(s). Each contact interface should be introduced in 
the bulk of the mesh as a SIDESET with a name starting with "INT_CONTACT". Up to 
30 contact interface can be defined, each including an arbitrary number of 
surfaces.

The following rules for the definition of contact interface apply:
1. External edge of a contact interfaces can belong to the skin of the solid 
mesh (i.e. contact interface may cut through the whole solid).
2. External edge of a contact interface can belong to the interior of the 
solid mesh if and only if this edge also belongs to another contact interface
(i.e. contact interfaces can intersect inside of the solid mesh, but a contact 
interface cannot cut the solid mesh partially, e.g. similar to a crack notch).

Additionally the following rules for including surfaces to contact interfaces 
apply:
1. If two surfaces share an external edge, they should be included into the same 
contact interface.
2. If two surface do not have shared edges, but the distance between these 
surfaces is less then 3 elements in the bulk mesh, they should be included 
separately into two different contact interfaces.

Contact parameters
==================

my_order        approximation order for the field of spatial positions
my_order_lambda approximation order for the field of Lagrange multipliers
my_r_value      regularisation parameter should be in [1.0, 1.1], values higher
                than 1.0 speed-up the convergence but introduce artificial     
                terms into contact work
my_cn_value     augmentation parameter, primarily affects the convergence and 
                has minimal effect on the solution; recommended initial value is 
                the Young's modulus of contacting solids (or average in case of 
                different values); the optimal value of cn providing minimal 
                number of iterations for a given tolerance threshold can be 
                found by repetitively increasing/decreasing the initial value 
                by e.g. a factor of 10

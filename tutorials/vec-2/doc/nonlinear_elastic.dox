/*! \page tutorial_nonlinear_elastic VEC-2: Nonlinear elastic

\note Prerequisites of this tutorial include \ref tutorial_elastic_problem and \ref basic_tutorials_poisson_nonlinear

<br>

\note Intended learning outcome:
- solving nonlinear vector-valued problem in MoFEM
- extension of linear elasticity to large strains with Hencky material
- developing code that can be compiled for 2D or 3D cases
- using matrix functions
- implementation of tangent stiffness matrix and verification with PETSc

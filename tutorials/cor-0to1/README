Check before run
================

* Check where is your mesh file
* Check what version of openmpi (or other MPI library) are you using

If you are using spack and you would like to use mpirun and mbconvert 
tools please first run the following 
======================================================================
spack load moab

Note
====
To solve larger problem, use mumps or pre-conditioner which would work with
saddle problems. Otherwise you will have problems.

Example for h adaptive transport
================================
./h_adaptive_transport \
-my_file l-shape.msh -meshsets_config bc.cfg  \
-my_order 1 -my_max_post_proc_ref_level 0 -nb_levels 5 2>&1 | tee log_order1


Example for unsaturated flow in mixed formulation
=================================================
./run_uf.sh soil_impermeable.cub unsaturated.cfg 4 0.001 1 0
./run_paper.sh paper.h5m paper.cfg 6 2e-5 0.008 1

Parameters set by default from param_file.petsc file
============================

-ksp_type fgmres 
-pc_type lu 
-pc_factor_mat_solver_type mumps 
-ksp_monitor

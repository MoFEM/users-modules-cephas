# Default material for VanGenuchten is Clay (no need to set paramters if clay is used)
# Assumed usinits are in meters and days.

# Model parameters controlling convergence
sCale=1e6       # Scale mass conservation equation
ePsilon1=1e-5   # Minimal capacity when removing spurious oscillations in time

Ah=-9 # head suction at z = 0
AhZ=1 #Â gradient of initial head suction
AhZZ=0 # initial head suction is calculated from equation h = Ah + AhZZ*z + AhZZ*zz
